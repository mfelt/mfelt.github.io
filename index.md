<br>
I am an insightful, customer-focused product manager. I love finding new ideas and designing solutions that customers love.

I have hands-on experience working with an agile team through all stages of product development. My specialties include working with customers, finding new opportunities, inventing creative solutions, designing smooth user experiences, prioritizing development stories, and performing comprehensive product tests.

I have extensive experience working with B2B customers and web-based applications.
