{% include h2 text="Fishbowl ShipExpress" %}

Fishbowl ShipExpress is a shipping solution for Fishbowl commerce customers. Allowing customers to easily print shipping labels.

I was tasked with researching the best way to integrate Fishbowl with all of the major shipping carriers. Building out individual integrations to each shipping carrier would have been costly and time-consuming. We decided to integrate with a shipping API solution called Shippo.

We built out full shipping functionality into Fishbowl and we used the Shippo API for the shipping carrier integration. 

I designed the user interface and made detailed specifications about how the Shippo integration would need to function.

We released ShipExpress on time and on budget.
