{% include h2 text="My Fishbowl Customer Portal" %}

My team and I created a customer portal for our customers that allows them to have visibility of their support requests, account information, and history from within the Fishbowl software.  

We implemented a web-based support system called {% include link url="https://frontapp.com/" text="Front" %} that allowed us to connect all of the support requests with the My Fishbowl customer portal.

***Support Process Automation***

I also designed a custom Front integration with that automates all of the manual work that our support teams had to do when working with customers.

This integration automatically connects to our CRM, displays needed customer details, and allows them to do all of their call tasks all in one system.

After these processes, Fishbowlâ€™s support department has been able to free up resources and save the hundreds of thousands of dollars each year. The VP of Support found that this automation saves **$295,000.000** and over **7,000** hours of time each year.


Here is a list of processes that we automated:

- Lookup customer account details from multiple internal systems and display information on each support request.
- Integrate with phone system to allow outbound dialing with the click of a button.
- Integrate voicemail transcription.
- Automatically save email replies directly to the customer's CRM account as notes.
- Automatically flag priority emails when key phrases are mentioned in a support request.
- Check customer account and automatically route requests to the assigned teams.
- Added a form to add call notes that are saved as notes on the customer's CRM account
