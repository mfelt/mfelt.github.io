{% include h2 text="Custom Front Integration" %}

Front is a web-based email application that I used to create a custom support solution for Fishbowl. Fishbowl's support teams have grown 25% year-over-year and have been unable to keep up with the volume of incoming support requests. I was assigned the task of finding, designing, and implementing a new support system that would allow the support team to be more efficient and cost-effective.

I designed processes that allowed Fishbowl's Support teams to streamline their tasks. I headed the project development with my team to create a custom Front integration that would automate many of their day-to-day tasks.

Development included building a custom application that retrieves relevant data from our internal systems and displays it within Front. We also added custom actions that allow the team to perform all of their tasks without leaving the system.

After implementing Front, Fishbowlâ€™s support department no longer needs to hire technical support at the extreme rate it was, saving the company hundreds of thousands of dollars each year. The VP of Internal Systems regularly reports on the productivity of my team and found that our innovative solution will save **$295,000.000** and over **7,000** hours of time each year.
