{% include h2 text="Custom Front Integration" %}

In 2016, Fishbowl's support team grew by 25% to over 50 employees. Even after growing our teams, they were still struggling to keep up with incoming support requests. We needed to find a way to make our support processes more efficient so we could more effectively scale our support teams.

After reviewing our processes, we found that our support agents we spending a lot of wasted time doing manual processes. I researched many different solutions and designed a custom plugin integration with a web-based email client called Front.

After implementing Front, our support teams are now able to stay caught up with requests and we no longer need to hire at the same pace.
